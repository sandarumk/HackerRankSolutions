# HackerRankSolutions
This Repository is a collection of Hackerrank Solutions.
The solutions may not be the optimal solutions. You can contribute adding optimal solutions or different ways of solving the same problem.

## How to contribute
1. Go through the already committed solutions to identify the style.
2. Add the Hackerrank question as the header comment with your name and the date created at the bottom.
3. Class name should be the name of the problem you are trying to solve.
4. If you are improving complexity add the complexity at the end of the classname. Most of the solutions given here are the bruteforce algorithms.
5. If you find any bug or any border case missed, please create an issue and report.

### Currently this repository is only for HackerRank Java questions.
